# 🕹️ Hey there! I’m Khalid 👋

I’m a gameplay programmer who loves building systems that *feel* good to play.  
Most of my work revolves around responsive controls, enemy AI, and gameplay loops with an emphasis on polish and player feedback.

A puzzle-platformer game created in 4-days for the 2025 GMTK Game Jam. The theme was *loop* .
Also built in GameMaker Studio 2, the game features a loop mechanic where you use your past versions of yourself as a platform to reach higher points and solve puzzles in the game.


### 🐛 **Centipede (Java)**
